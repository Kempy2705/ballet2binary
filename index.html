                        <h2>Welcome to Ballet2Binary!</h2>
                        <p class="content-text">My name is Daniel, a passionate programmer and ex-professional ballet dancer! Quite the combination don't you think? 
                            From a young age, I was inspired to move and share the joyous art of dance with everyone. What began as a hobby, soon became a passion and then ultimately a profession.
                            Inspired by the greats such as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Mikahil Baryshnikov, I went on to dance professionally, and travel the world doing so. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-text">
                            So where does programming come into this? Well, my interest in IT sparked in my teenage years not long after dance did. From building my own desktop system, to learning my first piece of code,
                            I found excitement in the many avenues that IT can lead you. Programming I found particularly interesting. The idea of creating something from scratch and turning that into something that people can see and use
                            is not so different from a dancer learning brand new choreography and performing it for an audience. Both offer oppurtunities to be creative. Both involve a lengthy,
                            carefully planned process and the final result has the capability to be shared with people.
